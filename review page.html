            <td>"The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho is like embarking on a profound journey that stays with you long after you turn the last page. This modern classic weaves a compelling tale about Santiago, a young Andalusian shepherd, who dreams of finding a hidden treasure. However, the true beauty of this book lies not in the destination, but in the journey itself. From the very beginning, Coelho's poetic and philosophical prose captures the reader's imagination. His writing is simple yet profound, making complex themes accessible and relatable. The narrative is rich with metaphors and allegories, each serving as a lesson about life, love, and the pursuit of one's dreams.</td>

            <td>"The God of Small Things" by Arundhati Roy is a literary masterpiece that left a profound impact on me. From the very first page, I was captivated by her poetic prose and the intricate, multi-layered narrative that intertwines the personal with the political. The novel is set in the lush, vibrant landscape of Kerala, India, and follows the lives of fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, whose world is shattered by the "Love Laws" that dictate "who should be loved, and how. And how much." Roy's storytelling is non-linear, which might be challenging for some, but I found it to be a brilliant way to gradually unveil the tragedy and the deep-seated issues of caste, class, and forbidden love.</td>
